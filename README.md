# Porn-block-host-file-for-windows-10-11
Hey fellow users I have created a host file with porn sites. You can add them in your host file on your pc. This file will help to block porn to protect you and your close ones. You can helps me out by posting link of sites that are not included in the host file. You need to copy the domain I have given in the file and then paste them in the host file of your windows 10/11 host file. However, I have conducted some research and found that when you add too many domains in the host file, it slows down you wifi speed and also affects the mobile hotspot feature in windows. I even faced the same issue while working on this project. I found a way to actually block all porn. To do this you must go on cloudflare website and then you will get DNS to block porn and malware. It works very well I have tested it.
